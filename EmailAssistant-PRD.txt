Based on the image provided, here is the text extracted, organized, and analyzed, followed by a technical roadmap to build this system.

###**I. Transcribed Text****Title:** Summary => Classification of new Emails

**Process Flow:**

1. **Script:** Checks email for new messages -> Read them.
2. **Action:** Classify the type of Email.

**Classification Categories:**

* **Need Action:** (High priority)
* **Just FYI - Updates:**
* Bill Due -> *Action: Add to Calendar*
* Credit Card (CC) Paid
* Changes to Service -> *Action: Add to Notes*
* Package Tracker


* **Marketing**
* **Spam**
* (A) -> Want me to unsubscribe
* (A) -> Delete Spam



**Output:**

* **End Goal:** Send "Summary Email"

**Technical Logic (Bottom Section):**

* Script runs 2x a day.
* Needs access to Gmail to read emails / Delete or Unsubscribe.
* Sends data to Gemini for classification.
* Organize / Prepare data for Summary Email.
* **Advanced Feature:** Can add Context & Memory for Rolling Events.

###**II. Analysis of the Task**You are designing an **"AI-Powered Email Executive Assistant"**.

Instead of you manually triageing your inbox, a script acts as a filter. It doesn't just sort emails; it "reads" them using Gemini to understand the *content*, performs digital chores (like adding bills to a calendar), and then gives you a brief daily digest.

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Security:** Giving a script permission to read/delete your emails requires careful OAuth setup.
2. **"Unsubscribe" Logic:** This is tricky. Programmatic unsubscribing usually requires parsing specific email headers (`List-Unsubscribe`) or navigating the web, which is complex for a simple script.
3. **Memory:** Tracking "Rolling Events" implies the script needs a database or a log file to remember what happened in the morning run so it makes sense in the evening run.

###**III. How to Accomplish This (Implementation Plan)**Here is a step-by-step guide to building this using **Python** and **Google Cloud**.

####**Step 1: The Tech Stack*** **Language:** Python (best libraries for Gmail and AI).
* **APIs:**
* **Gmail API:** To fetch emails, modify labels (archive/trash), and send the summary.
* **Google Calendar API:** To add "Bill Due" events.
* **Gemini API (Google AI Studio):** To analyze the text and classify it.


* **Hosting:** Google Cloud Functions (serverless, cheap/free) or a local Raspberry Pi/Server.

####**Step 2: The Workflow Logic****1. Fetching (The Input)**
Use the Gmail API to search for messages received in the last 12 hours.

* *Filter:* `label:INBOX is:unread newer_than:12h`

**2. The "Brain" (Gemini Integration)**
Loop through the emails and send the `subject` and `body` to Gemini. You need a structured prompt to get clean data back.

> **Prompt Strategy:**
> "I will paste an email below. Respond ONLY with a JSON object containing:
> * `category`: (Action, FYI, Marketing, Spam)
> * `summary`: (One sentence summary)
> * `action_item`: (e.g., 'Add to calendar', 'Unsubscribe', 'None')
> * `date_due`: (If applicable)"
> 
> 

**3. The Execution (The Actions)**
Parse the JSON response from Gemini:

* **If `category` == "Spam":** Call Gmail API to `trash` the message.
* **If `action_item` == "Add to calendar":** Parse the `date_due` and use the Calendar API to create an all-day event.
* **If `action_item` == "Unsubscribe":** This is hard to automate safely. *Suggestion:* Instead of auto-unsubscribing, have the script apply a Gmail Label named "To Unsubscribe" so you can do them all in one batch later.

**4. The Memory (Context)**
To handle "Rolling Events," save a simple `log.json` file.

* When the script runs, it reads `log.json` to see previous context.
* *Example:* If an email says "Re: Project X", the script checks the log to see what "Project X" is about before summarizing.

**5. The Output (Summary Email)**
Collect all the summaries into a clean HTML format.

* **Header:** "Morning Briefing"
* **Section 1 (Action Items):** "You need to reply to Mom." / "Pay Electric Bill."
* **Section 2 (FYI):** "Netflix bill paid." / "Amazon package shipped."
* **Footer:** "Processed 45 emails. Deleted 12 spam messages."
Send this email to yourself via the Gmail API.

####**Step 3: Automation*** **Option A (Easiest):** Run it locally on your computer using Windows Task Scheduler or Mac Cron. (Computer must be on).
* **Option B (Best):** Deploy to **Google Cloud Functions** and use **Cloud Scheduler** to trigger it at 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM.
